# @iabtechlabtcf/cmpapi

Ensures other in-page digital marketing technologies have access to CMP transparency and consent information for the [IAB's Transparency and Consent Framework (TCF)](https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/GDPR-Transparency-and-Consent-Framework).

# CmpApi

`CmpApi` is the only class needed to provide in-page digital marketing technologies access to a CMP transparency and consent information.
The process involves setting the state of a few properties and/or a validly ecnoded [TC string](https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/GDPR-Transparency-and-Consent-Framework/blob/master/TCFv2/IAB%20Tech%20Lab%20-%20Consent%20string%20and%20vendor%20list%20formats%20v2.md#about-the-transparency--consent-string-tc-string)

## Installation

npm
```
npm install @iabtechlabtcf/cmpapi --save
```

yarn
```
yarn add @iabtechlabtcf/cmpapi
```



## Create CmpApi

To create an instance of the CmpApi. Pass in your Cmp ID (assigned by IAB) and the Version (integer), and whether or not this instance is configured to use a [service-specific scope](https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/GDPR-Transparency-and-Consent-Framework/blob/master/TCFv2/IAB%20Tech%20Lab%20-%20Consent%20string%20and%20vendor%20list%20formats%20v2.md#what-are-the-different-scopes-for-a-tc-string) to the constructor.

A [custom commands object map](#custom-commands) may optionally be passed to extend the page-call functionality as well.

````javascript
import {CmpApi} from '@iabtechlabtcf/cmpapi';

const cmpApi = new CmpApi(1, 3, true);
````

During construction of the `CmpApi`, the `window.__tcfapi` stub is replaced
with `CmpApi`'s own function for handling `window.__tcfapi` command requests.
Commands that were waiting to be executed in the stub are filtered out if not
valid. Ping and custom commands are executed and removed from the queue while
all other commands remain queued until a valid [TC
string](https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/GDPR-Transparency-and-Consent-Framework/blob/master/TCFv2/IAB%20Tech%20Lab%20-%20Consent%20string%20and%20vendor%20list%20formats%20v2.md#about-the-transparency--consent-string-tc-string)
is set.

**Note:** After creation, `window.__tcfapi` will respond to "ping" commands and custom commands only. All other commands
will be queue until `update()` is called for the first time.

## Trigger Change Event

In the [specification](https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/GDPR-Transparency-and-Consent-Framework/blob/master/TCFv2/IAB%20Tech%20Lab%20-%20CMP%20API%20v2.md#addeventlistener), events occur and registered callbacks are called "whenever the TC String is changed and a new one is available".  `CmpApi` will trigger an event whenever `update` is called.
````javascript
cmpApi.update(encodedTCString || '' || null);
````

`update()` may be called either an encoded [TC
string](https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/GDPR-Transparency-and-Consent-Framework/blob/master/TCFv2/IAB%20Tech%20Lab%20-%20Consent%20string%20and%20vendor%20list%20formats%20v2.md#creating-a-tc-string)
an empty string (`''`) or `null`.

* Encoded TC string, `CmpApi` will decode the string and respond to [`TCData`](https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/GDPR-Transparency-and-Consent-Framework/blob/master/TCFv2/IAB%20Tech%20Lab%20-%20CMP%20API%20v2.md#tcdata) with the decoded values.
  * `gdprApplies` will be set to `true`
* Empty string (`''`), `CmpApi` will respond to [`TCData`](https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/GDPR-Transparency-and-Consent-Framework/blob/master/TCFv2/IAB%20Tech%20Lab%20-%20CMP%20API%20v2.md#tcdata) with the correct structure but all primitive values will be empty.
  * `gdprApplies` will be set to `true`
* `null`, `CmpApi` will respond to [`TCData`](https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/GDPR-Transparency-and-Consent-Framework/blob/master/TCFv2/IAB%20Tech%20Lab%20-%20CMP%20API%20v2.md#tcdata) with the correct structure but all primitive values will be empty.
  * `gdprApplies` will be set to `false`

`CmpApi` needs to know when you are going to show the user the UI to the user
to recapture consent in order to set the correct
[`eventStatus`](https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/GDPR-Transparency-and-Consent-Framework/blob/master/TCFv2/IAB%20Tech%20Lab%20-%20CMP%20API%20v2.md#addeventlistener).
The second parameter is a `boolean` letting `CmpApi` know that the UI is now
visible to the user (it defaults to `false`).

### Show UI – TC string needs update

````javascript

// showing the ui to the user
cmpApi.update(encodedTCString, true);

/** CMP gathers user preferences */

cmpApi.update(updatedEncodedTCString, false);

````

### Don't Show UI – TC string does not need an update

````javascript

// not showing the ui to the user, only one update is needed
cmpApi.update(encodedTCString, false);

````

### Show UI – New User – no TC string

````javascript

// showing the ui to the user
cmpApi.update('', true);

/** CMP gathers user preferences */

cmpApi.update(updatedEncodedTCString, false);

````

### GDPR doesn't apply
In the case that GDPR does not apply, simply update with null. That's all.

````javascript

// only one update needed to let CmpApi that gdpr doesn't apply
cmpApi.update(null);

````

## Disabling the CmpApi
If, for any reason, we are unable to perform the operations in compliance with
the TCF and thus should not continue to serve page request commands (other than ping),
the `CmpApi` provides a disable method. Calling the disabled method will put the `CmpApi`
into a permanent error state. Only ping and custom commands will continue to be executed
for page requests.

````javascript
cmpApi.disable();
````

## Custom Commands
`CmpApi` has an optional parameter to pass in your map of custom commands.
`CmpApi` will not perform any validation on custom commands. The CMP is
responsible for handling validations and errors. Custom function signatures
must have a callback and may define additonal params that will be passed from
the calling script.

**Example**
````javascript

import {CmpApi} from '@iabtechlabtcf/cmpapi';

const cmpApi = new CmpApi(1, 3, false, {

  'bingo': (callback, dogName) => {

    callback(`There was a farmer who had a dog, and ${dogName} was his name-o`);

  },

  'connectBones': (callback, startBone, endBone) => {

    callback(`The ${startBone} bone is connected to the ${endBone} bone.`);

  },

});

const songLyricCallback = (lyrics, success) => {

  if(success) {

    console.log(lyrics)

  } else {

    console.error('Error: could not get song lyrics')

  }

}

__tcfapi('bingo', 2, songLyricCallback, 'Bingo');
// ouput: There was a farmer who had a dog, and Bingo was his name-o

__tcfapi('connectBones', 2, songLyricCallback, 'knee', 'thigh');
// ouput: The knee bone is connected to the thigh bone

````
### Built-In and Custom Commands
Beginning in 1.1.0, if a custom command is defined that overlaps with a built-in command (`"ping"`, `"getTCData"`, `"getInAppTCData"`, `"getVendorList"`) then the custom command will act as a "middleware" being passed the built-in command's response and expected to pass along the response when finished.

**Note:** `"addEventListener"` and `"removeEventListener"` can __not__ be overwritten.  `"addEventListener"` utilizes the `"getTCData"` command, so to modify `TCData` responses, write a Built-In custom command for that command and both `"getTCData"` and `"addEventListener"` will utilize it.  If the `"removeEventListener"` command is also used with a custom `"getTCData"` command, note that `"removeEventListener"` will not return `tcData` but rather a boolean that indicates if the listener was removed.  So it is important to add a check, otherwise the CmpApi will catch that error and the callbacks will return with `tcData: null`.

**Example**
````javascript

import {CmpApi} from '@iabtechlabtcf/cmpapi';

const cmpApi = new CmpApi(1, 3, false, {

  'getTCData': (next, tcData, status) => {

    /*
     * If using with 'removeEventListener' command, add a check to see if tcData is not a boolean. */
    if (typeof tcData !== 'boolean') {

      // tcData will be constructed via the TC string and can be added to here
      tcData.reallyImportantExtraProperty = true;

    }

    // pass data and status along
    next(tcData, status);


  },

});


````
**Note**: If the `next()` function is not called with the `TCData` object, then the caller's callback will not be executed.
